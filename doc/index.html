This code is an implementation of the basic perfusion methodology as 
outlined by Ostergaard (MRM 1996). Some fancy bits were added though 
mainly for considering the effects of tracer delay. There are as 
follows : <BR>

<DL>
    <DT>
    <B>aif_fit and conc_fit : </B><BR>
     <BR>
     
    <DD>
    Instead of considering the time-curves for the arterial input function 
    and each voxel directly, a gamma variate function may be fit to these 
    curves and this gamma variate function considered instead. <BR>
     <BR>
     <BR>
     
    <DT>
    <B>shift_aif, shift_aif_exact and shift_conc : </B><BR>
     <BR>
     
    <DD>
    Once a measure of the tracer delay has been determined, the aif may be 
    aligned to the voxel (either within one tr, ie. the resolution of the 
    signal time-curves, or interpolation may be used to fit these 
    concentrations exactly), or the voxel may be aligned with the aif. 
    These parameters will either affect the aif matrix or each individual 
    voxel time-curve. <BR>

     <BR>
     
    <DT>
    <B>bat_gamma : </B><BR>
     <BR>
     
    <DD>
    The start of the concentration time-curve is defined as the bolus 
    arrival time (BAT) of the gamma variate function. <BR>

    <DT>
    <B>bat_slope : </B><BR>
     <BR>
     
    <DD>
    The start of the concentation time-curve is defined by drawing a line 
    between the start of the measured profile and the maximum height of the 
    curve, and then determining the point that is furtherest from this 
    line. <BR>

    <DT>
    <B>bat_cutoff : </B><BR>
     <BR>
     
    <DD>
    The start of the concentation time-curve is defined as a certain 
    percentage of the maximum of the curve. <BR>
